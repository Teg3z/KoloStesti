"""
wheel_of_luck.py

The main module.

Manages the application's UI, starts the corresponding Discord bot and sends it commands.
Maintains the wheel spinning logic and sends results into a MongoDB database.

Main Functions:
- remove_unwated_games:
    Hides every game in the wheels UI that doesn't have the correct category.
- choose_winning_game:
    Randomly chooses one game out of a list of Game objects based on their desire percentage.
- spin_wheel:
    The whole wheel spinning logic is in this function.
- send_message_to_discord:
    Sends a new coroutine to the thread that the Discord bot is running on,
    telling the bot to send a message on Discord.
- main:
    The main entry point of the application.

Dependencies:
- Requires asyncio to manage the event loop, so that the application can wait for coroutines,
    like waiting for Discord bot to send a message.
- Requires threading for running the Discord bot on a separate thread.
- Requires PySimpleGUI for the application's simple UI.
- Requires discord_bot to send commands to the Discord bot.
- Requires db_handler for all the databe operations and establishment.
